# WebSSO
The package provides a command that will set up WebSSO, and optionally Duo multi-factor authentication (MFA). 

- Create SSO & Duo controllers in `App\Http\Controllers\Auth`
- Adds named routes to your `web/routes.php`
- Ejects a `resources/views/auth/mfa.blade.php` template for rendering the Duo MFA widget

The approach taken is flexible. It is suited for both applications that only use WebSSO *and* applications with multiple login methods.

All of the above will still rely on the built-in Laravel `auth` middleware.

:::warning Notes for Advanced Users
Authentication is achieved by logging users into Laravel; once the webSSO session is validated, your user's login session for your application is detached from the webSSO session.

The package does not implement a custom [auth provider](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/authentication#adding-custom-user-providers) and relies on the default database provider for the `App\User` model.
:::

## Setting up SSO
Getting webSSO working should only take a few minutes.

```
php artisan make:websso
```

First, review your `routes/web.php`. You can adjust the paths, if desired.

Then, open up `App\Http\Controllers\Auth\WebSSOController` and implement the `findUserByNetID` method. 

It needs to return an object that implements the `Authenticatable` interface. The `App\User` model that Laravel comes with satisfies this requirement. 

If you return `null` from this method, the login will fail. This may be desired in cases where only certain pre-approved users are permitted to log in.

```php
use App\User;

protected function findUserByNetID(string $netid): ?Authenticatable
{
    // If the user exists, they can log in.
    $user = User::where('netid', $netid)->first();
    if ($user !== null) {
        return $user;
    }

    // If you have a Directory Search API key, you could grab info about them & create a user.
    $directory = $this->directory_api->lookupNetId($netid, 'basic');
    $user = User::create([
        'name' => $netid,
        'email' => $directory['mail'],
    ]);

    return $user;
}
```

You may optionally implement the `authenticated` method. If you return a `redirect()`, it will be followed. Otherwise, the default Laravel behaviour will be used.

## Enabling Duo MFA
If you want to enable Duo MFA, you will need to submit a ticket to Identity Services team via [consultant@northwestern.edu](mailto:consultant@northwestern.edu):

> Hi Identity Services,
>
>Can you create a new Web SDK application for us in Duo, called [application or project name]?
>
>We need the following info from you once it's created:
>
>- Integration key (IKEY)
>- Secret key (SKEY)
>- API URL
> 
>Thank you very much!

Once you have recieved this information, you must generated an application key (AKEY). Duo recommends a 40+ character string, which you can create by running `bin2hex(random_bytes(32))` in the tinker console.

With these four config items in hand, update your `.env`:

```
DUO_ENABLED=true
DUO_IKEY=
DUO_SKEY=
DUO_AKEY=
DUO_URL=
```

You may need to update the `resources/views/auth/mfa.blade.php` file to fit your site layout; it assumes the default Laravel `layouts.app` template is being used.

Duo should now be enabled.

## Changing Routes
The default route names `login`, `logout`, and `mfa.index` are used by the controller traits.

If you want to rename these routes, you will need to override these properties in both controllers.

```php
class WebSSOController extends Controller
{
    protected $login_route_name = 'login';
    protected $logout_route_name = 'logout';
    protected $mfa_route_name = 'mfa.index';

    // . . .
}
```

If you are only using WebSSO to authenticate in your app, this should not be necessary. If you have multiple login methods, you will either need to rename the routes, or update your `App\Http\Middleware\Authenticate` to send unauthenticated users to page that lets them choose their login method.

## API
The webSSO class will resolve the value of an `openAMssoToken` cookie into a NetID.

:::tip Unusual Use-cases Only
If you have set up the authentication controllers as detailed in [the previous section](#authentication-flow), you should not need to use the `WebSSO` class yourself.
:::

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Northwestern\SysDev\SOA\WebSSO;

class MyController extends Controllers
{
    public function login(Request $request, WebSSO $sso)
    {
        // Note that $request->cookie() won't work here.
        // It requires that all cookies be set by Laravel & encrypted with the app's key.
        $token = $_COOKIE['openAMssoToken'];

        $netid = $sso->getNetID($token);
        if ($netid == false) {
            // Error
            dd($sso->getLastError());
        }

        dd($netid); // netID as a string with no frills
    }
}
```
