## Contributing
If you'd like to contribute to the library, you are welcome to submit a pull request!

My ideal architecture (going forward :cold_sweat:) is to write plain-old PHP bindings (so folks can use them in non-Laravel apps) and then have the `NuSoaServiceProvider` inject config & add any other Laravel-specific enhancements.

If there is a service on the API Registry that you'd like to see included, please go ahead and open an issue requesting it.
